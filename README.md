react-css-builder
==============
CSS builder for creating inline react component style objects

If you want React to do native well, you need to use inline styles.  But, you can still get the DRY and maintainability benefits of an external stylesheet with react-css-builder.

The advantages of creating the CSS attributes using javascript are

* You can use runtime variables
* You can use scoped (global, stylesheet specific and style reference specific)
* There is a large byte savings if you use a lot of mixins and class inheritance
* You bypass some browser CSS issues because the style attributes end up as an inline style attribute
