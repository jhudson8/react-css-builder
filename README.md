react-css-builder
==============
CSS builder for creating inline react component style objects

If you want React to do native well, you need to use inline styles.  But, you can still get the DRY and maintainability benefits of an external stylesheet with react-css-builder.

You can create a javascript stylesheet similar to what you would see with a CSS precompiler but you can actually use variables calculated at runtime!
